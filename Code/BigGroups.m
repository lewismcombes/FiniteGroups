/***********
Try to find minimal permutation rep (have a lot of this data).  This is likely the best to compute with.
Run IrreducibleModules(G, K) for K=Q and for K a small finite fields.  Save this!  Derive character table and rational character table (and rational).  Use MaxDegree parameter (char 0) or DimLim (char p)
Complex characters, resulting quantities (monomial, faithful reps)
Find automorphism group and save it (make sure to use existing computations)
Try to find the holomorph, and the consequences up to autjugacy (probably only feasible for somewhat small groups)
Find normal subgroups (and resulting quantities, like direct product factorization).  This probably involves rewriting the NormalSubgroups intrinsic to not call Subgroups.
Find all subgroups (and resulting quantities, like semidirect products, rank, eulerian function, better group names)

Generate a list of subs/quos for hashing and identification (don't add them, but it would be good to know if they're already there)
Other stuff (schur_multiplier, wreath_data)
